# Travel-Salesman(Hard constraint programming)
A repository for the implementation of a hard constraint programming solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This repository provides an efficient solver that tackles the TSP with hard constraints, ensuring optimal solutions within given constraints.

Program in a language of your choice the following three procedures for constructing a solution to the traveling salesman problem:
1. Generation of a random tour
2. 2. Choose a city randomlyRepeat n-1 times:Choose the city not yet visited that is closest to the one where you are and go there
3. 3. Choose a city randomlyCreate n-1 "star" routes each containing 2 citiesRepeat n-2 times:Merge the two routes that save the maximum distance Give the average length (relative to the best known solution) of the routes provided by these heuristics as well as their execution time, for the following problems of the TSPLIB library:berlin52, eil101, lin318, pr1002, rl5934, d18512Graphically represent the routes obtained.
